# TraceLink Opus Platform Code Samples #

## Communicating with Agile Process Teams using code ##  

This repository provides developers with code samples for interacting with the Agile Process Teams (APT) app.  

APT is a multienterprise work management app that allows Owners to collaborate with cross-enterprise and cross-functional trade partners throughout the supply chain by digitally executing, managing, and tracking shared business processes, which increases speed and improves the effectiveness of the supply chain. Agile Process Teams allows companies to create multiple networks that use the following processes for this digital collaboration:  

- Change Requests
- Document Review
- Incidents including Compliance Exception, Direct Supplier, External Manufacturing
- Tasks

Additional functionality will be added to this repository as it becomes available.
